# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediciton
This was my first task at Cellula's technologies where I learned how to use Flask and clean data from unnecessary outliers
Since the model was binary (Canclled/Not-Cancelled) I compared multiple models in order to determine which model is the best
The model XGBoost scored the highest accuracy which is why it was determined to be the model to be used in the Dataset
